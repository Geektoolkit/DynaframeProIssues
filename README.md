A publicly available Git Hub Issues Page for DynaframePro:
https://github.com/Geektoolkit/DynaframeProIssues/issues

Please use the page to let us know of anything broken, please be as detailed as possible and always include the build number you encountered this on.  

Please also use the page to make feature requests, or share ideas.

Finally this is another way to ask a question, or share your knowledge, if discord is too daunting, distracting, or otherwise inconvenient, this page can be a backup portal to get some help with issues impacting your DynaframePro Project.

We are really grateful for your participation, and support, and know that we hear your wants, and will always do our best to find you answers, or help.

Basic rules:
1) Treat others with respect. 
2) Please do not paste any links from the Patreon in any issues. 
3) Have fun
